                    <p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers that would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its delivery drones to take off and land. The facilities would be built vertically to blend in with high rises in urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one.
                   The patent application, filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings of these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center and one that looks like a UFO</p>

                    <h2>Japanese foods we love-Sushi</h2>
                    <p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.
                    Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa in Roppongi  is nothing short of perfection.  At around ¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.</p>

                    <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
                    <p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
                    "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

                    <p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do, eat and explore both indoors and out.</p>

                    <p>Just minutes before the Humane Society Shelter in Bangor, Maine closed for the day on Tuesday, they only had one lone puppy left who had yet to be adopted.  Not to worry however, that puppy too found a great forever home, marking the end of an amazing campaign to save some dogs on death row from a high-kill shelter in the southern United States.Ada Webb was the lucky person to adopt that final dog.
                     Webb had been in line there for quite some time waiting to adopt, hoping to be able to surprise her nine-year-old son with a new, four-legged furry family member.  </p>

                    <p>With nearly 2 billion people around the world checking in monthly, it makes sense that Facebook is dealing with some very sticky issues. The social network is facing increasing pressure to address them head on.
